CapitalView provides a quick possibilto to collect all the **bank transactions in Google Spreadsheet**. 
1. First, we create a personal user account CapitalView website and link personal bank accounts.
2. Then, select the bankâ€™s location and bank name where an account is based. Confirm the read access to the transactions data.
3. Install the [Google Sheets Addon](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/capitalview/375261803937) that will populate the data into a spreadsheet. 
4. Use personal token id for authentication and enjoy the data without unnecessary logins to bank account systems.
